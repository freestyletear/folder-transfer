            With technological advancement happening at an unprecedented
            rate, yesterday's science fiction is quickly turning into
            today's reality. From self-driving cars, the space-station,
            virtual and augmented reality and now bezel-less phones. This
            year alone, four major smartphones with minimal bezels have hit
            the market. It would appear that indeed, human exploits are
            limited only by imagination. What do you suppose will be the
            next science fiction to be actualised?
